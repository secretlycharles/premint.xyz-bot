## History
This project was developed in 2022 for a group of people interested in automating entries for premints for nfts. It automated 'premint.xyz' links with ease and ended in development around a few months later.

With this project I supported friends, groups, and communities all interested in making money with nft premints.  

## What did this bot have to offer?
A seamless but unique experience in solving your premint.xyz links.
